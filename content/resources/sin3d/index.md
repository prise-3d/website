# Description

This dataset is composed of 80 points of view of photo realistics images with different level of samples for each. The most noisy image is of 20 samples and the reference one (the most converged image obtained) is of 10000 samples.

# Dataset overview

Some views of the image _Living room 3_ produced during paths sampling according to an increasing number of samples. Noise is highly visible on the two low sampled views.
