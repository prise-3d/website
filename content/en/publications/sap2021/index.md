# Abstract
Producing a very high-quality computer-generated image (CGI), termed photorealistic, involves lighting
simulations that require significant computing power.
The CGI algorithms induce some visual noise, which varies inversely with the number of iterations. A major issue is to automatically decide when to stop the image computation without a detectable loss of visual quality to optimize computing time
